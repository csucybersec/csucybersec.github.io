                    <h2>Google's Project Zero team discovered critical CPU flaw</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        In 2015, Google's Project Zero team discovered a
                        hardware vulnerability, called Meltdown and Spectre, affecting Intel x86, IBM POWER and some ARM-based
                        microprocessors. It allows a rogue process to read all memory including security and private data,
                        even when it is not authorized to do so. Meltdown affects a wide range of systems. At the time of disclosure,
                        this included all devices running any but the most recent and patched versions of iOS, Linux, macOS,
                        or Windows. Accordingly, many servers and cloud services were impacted, as well as a potential
                        majority of smart devices and embedded devices using ARM based processors (mobile devices, smart TVs,
                        printers and others), including a wide range of networking equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        A purely software workaround to
                        Meltdown has been assessed as slowing computers between 5 and 30 percent in certain specialized workloads,
                        although companies responsible for software correction of the exploit are reporting minimal impact from
                        general benchmark testing. No known attacks have been reported yet though. In fact, Apple was
                        hit with a class action lawsuit by New York lawyer Mark Rifkin, which alleges that Apple
                        knowingly sold devices with the security flaws to customers and did not inform customers that
                        the fixes could cause a performance slowdown, affecting the quality of their products. Intel has
                        already faced a number of lawsuits in relation to this security 
                        flaws, including a class action suit filed by
                        Rifkin's law firm, Wolf Haldenstein.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The Project Zero researcher, Jann Horn, demonstrated that malicious actors could take advantage of 
                        speculative execution to read system memory that should have been inaccessible. For example, an 
                        unauthorized party may read sensitive information in the system's memory such as passwords, encryption 
                        keys, or sensitive information open in applications. Testing also showed that an attack running on one 
                        virtual machine was able to access the physical memory of the host machine, and through that, gain 
                        read-access to the memory of a different virtual machine on the same host.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        These vulnerabilities affect many CPUs, including those from AMD, ARM, and Intel, as well as the devices 
                        and operating systems running on them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        As soon as Google learned of this new class of attack, their security and product development teams mobilized 
                        to defend Google's systems and their users' data. Google have updated their systems and affected products to 
                        protect against this new type of attack. Google also collaborated with hardware and software manufacturers 
                        across the industry to help protect their users and the broader web. These efforts have included collaborative 
                        analysis and the development of novel mitigations.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        To take advantage of this vulnerability, an attacker first must be able to run malicious code on the targeted system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The Project Zero researchers discovered three methods (variants) of attack, which are effective 
                        under different conditions. All three attack variants can allow a process with normal user privileges 
                        to perform unauthorized reads of memory data, which may contain sensitive information such as passwords, 
                        cryptographic key material, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        In order to improve performance, many CPUs may choose to speculatively execute instructions based on 
                        assumptions that are considered likely to be true. During speculative execution, the processor is 
                        verifying these assumptions; if they are valid, then the execution continues.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        If they are invalid, then the execution is unwound, and the correct execution path can be started 
                        based on the actual conditions. It is possible for this speculative execution to have side effects 
                        which are not restored when the CPU state is unwound, and can lead to information disclosure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        There is no single fix for all three attack variants; each requires protection independently. Many 
                        vendors have patches available for one or more of these attacks.

                    <h2>What Are Meltdown and Spectre?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Spectre is a “fundamental design flaw” that exists in every CPU on the market—including those 
                        from AMD and ARM as well as Intel. There is currently no software fix, and it will likely require 
                        a complete hardware redesign for CPUs across the board—though thankfully it is fairly difficult 
                        to exploit, according to security researchers. It's possible to protect against specific Spectre 
                        attacks, and developers are working on it, but the best solution will be a CPU hardware redesign for all future chips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meltdown basically makes Spectre worse by making the core underlying flaw much easier to exploit. 
                        It's essentially an additional flaw that affects all Intel processors made in the past few decades. 
                        It also affects some high-end ARM Cortex-A processors, but it doesn't affect AMD chips. Meltdown 
                        is being patched in operating systems today.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/scenario2/flow.png" width="" height="">

                    <h2>But how do these flaws work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Programs running on your computer run with different levels of security permissions. The operating 
                        system kernel—the Windows kernel or the Linux kernel, for example—has the highest level of permissions 
                        because it runs the show. Desktop programs have fewer permissions and the kernel restricts what they 
                        can do. The kernel uses the processor's hardware features to help enforce some of these restrictions, 
                        because it's faster to do it with hardware than software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem here is with “speculative execution”. For performance reasons, modern CPUs automatically 
                        run instructions they think they might need to run and, if they don't, they can simply rewind and 
                        return the system to its previous state. However, a flaw in Intel and some ARM processors allows 
                        processes to run operations that they wouldn't normally be able to run, as the operation is performed 
                        before the processor bothers to check whether it should have permission to run it or not. That's the Meltdown bug.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The core problem with both Meltdown and Spectre lies within the CPU's cache. An application can attempt 
                        to read memory and, if it reads something in the cache, the operation will complete faster. If it tries 
                        to read something not in the cache, it will complete slower. The application can see whether or not 
                        something completes fast or slow and, while everything else during speculative execution is cleaned up and 
                        erased, the time it took to perform the operation can't be hidden. It can then use this information to build 
                        a map of anything in the computer's memory, one bit at a time. The caching speeds things up, but these attacks 
                        take advantage of that optimization and turns it into a security flaw.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, in a worst case scenario, JavaScript code running in your web browser could effectively read memory it 
                        shouldn't have access to, such as private information held in other applications. Cloud providers like Microsoft 
                        Azure or Amazon Web Services, who host multiple different company's software in different virtual machines 
                        on the same hardware are particularly at risk. One person's software could, in theory, spy on things in 
                        another company's virtual machine. It's a breakdown in the separation between applications. The patches for 
                        Meltdown means this attack won't be as easy to pull off. Unfortunately, putting these extra checks into place 
                        means some operations will be slower on affected hardware.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Do I Need to Do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some updates to fix the Meltdown issue are already available. Microsoft has issued an emergency update 
                        to supported versions of Windows via Windows Update on January 3, 2018, but it hasn't made it to all PCs 
                        yet. The Windows Update that solves the Meltdown and adds some protections against Spectre is named KB4056892.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apple already patched the issue with macOS 10.13.2, released on December 6, 2017. Chromebooks with Chrome 
                        OS 63, which was released in mid-December, are already protected. Patches are also available for the Linux kernel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, check to see if your PC has BIOS/UEFI updates available. While the Windows update fixed the 
                        Meltdown problem, CPU microcode updates from Intel delivered via a UEFI or BIOS update are needed to fully 
                        enable protection against one of the Spectre attacks. You should also update your web browser—as usual—as 
                        browsers are adding some protections against Spectre, as well.

                        one but that works in another segment.
