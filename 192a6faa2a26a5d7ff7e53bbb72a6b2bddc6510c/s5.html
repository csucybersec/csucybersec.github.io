                    <h2>What exactly happened at <strong>Boston's Children Hospital?</strong></h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Multiple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks hit Boston Children's 
                        Hospital over the weekend of April 19, 2013. The attacks knocked the hospital 
                        offline for days, which was enough to critically disrupt the hospital's 
                        day-to-day operations and its research capabilities. The attacks were part of 
                        #OpJustina, a campaign of the Anonymous hacker collective and aimed to raise 
                        public interest in the case of Justina Pelletier, a young girl who was separated 
                        from her parents after a (mis)diagnosis made by Boston Children's Hospital medical 
                        staff.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        DDoS attacks were against the Wayside Youth and Family Support Network, 
                        a Framingham-based mental health counseling clinic where Pelletier was held, 
                        but also against Boston Children's Hospital and other Longwood Medical Area hospitals. 
                        It may begin with a righteous intention but the main figure of the attacks was 
                        arrested in 2016, and sentenced on January 10, 2019 to ten years in prison. 
                        He was also ordered to pay $443,000 in restitution for damages caused by his DDoS 
                        attacks, which he allegedly carried out with the help of a botnet made up of over 40,000 internet routers.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        According to her family Justina had been receiving treatment for mitochondrial disease 
                        at Tufts Medical Center. When she came down with the u, Tufts doctors advised Justina's 
                        parents to take her to Boston Children's Hospital. There, Dr. Newton decided that Justina 
                        had been misdiagnosed. She really had somatoform, a psychiatric disorder that causes physical 
                        ailments, the physician decided. Her parents protested a plan to remove Justina from her treatments 
                        for mitochondrial disorder in favor of psychiatric treatments. When they tried to discharge her to 
                        take her back to Tufts, they were slapped with a <strong>51A (a report of alleged physical or emotional 
                        abuse)</strong>. Currently, signs are pointing to Justina being returned to her home state of Connecticut 
                        soon. A state health official on Friday penned a letter supporting Justina's return to 
                        Connecticut and saying that the "groundwork" for a "reunification plan" has been laid, 
                        as The Blaze reports. Some state lawmakers have also petitioned that the Pelletiers's 
                        daughter be returned to them, while family advocates have called upon Massachusetts 
                        Gov. Deval Patrick to address the case as well.

                        Anonymous members, Gottesfeld included, followed suite on their threats. DDoS attacks 
                        crippled Wayside's network for a week, causing $18,000 in damages, but they did more 
                        damage to the Boston Children's Hospital.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        US law enforcement says Gottesfeld was behind DDoS attacks against the Boston hospital on April 19, 2014, 
                        when he used a botnet of over 40,000 routers to knock the hospital off the Internet.The attack was 
                        so powerful that it not only knocked the Boston Children's Hospital offline 
                        but also nearby hospitals in the Longwood Medical Area.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Authorities said the DDoS attack disrupted the Boston hospital's day-to-day operations, as 
                        well as its research capabilities. The attack caused damages that took more than $300,000 to repair, 
                        but also caused revenue losses of around $300,000 due to lost donations after the hospital's fundraising 
                        portal was also taken offline. The hospital needed around two weeks to fully come back online.

                    <h2>What Is a DDoS Attack and How Does It Work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        DDoS is short for distributed denial of service. A DDoS attack occurs when 
                        a threat actor uses resources from multiple, remote locations to attack 
                        an organization's online operations. Usually, DDoS attacks focus on generating 
                        attacks that manipulate the default, or even proper workings, of network 
                        equipment and services (e.g., routers, naming services or caching services). 
                        In fact, that's the main problem.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/scenario5/flow.gif" style="margin-left: 25%;">

                    <p>
                        Sophisticated DDoS attacks don't necessarily have to take advantage of default 
                        settings or open relays. They exploit normal behavior and take advantage of 
                        how the protocols that run on today's devices were designed to run in the first 
                        place. In the same way that a social engineer manipulates the default workings 
                        of human communication, a DDoS attacker manipulates the normal workings of the 
                        network services we all rely upon and trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        When a DDoS attack takes place, the targeted organization experiences a 
                        crippling interruption in one or more of its services because the attack 
                        has flooded their resources with HTTP requests and traffic, denying access to 
                        legitimate users. DDoS attacks are ranked as one of the top four cybersecurity 
                        threats of our time, amongst social engineering, ransomware and supply chain attacks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Types of DDoS Attack</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Application Layer Attacks:</strong> The goal of these attacks is to 
                        exhaust the resources of the target. The attacks target the 
                        layer where web pages are generated on the server and delivered 
                        in response to HTTP requests. A single HTTP request is cheap 
                        to execute on the client side, and can be expensive for the 
                        target server to respond to as the server often must load multiple 
                        files and run database queries in order to create a web page. 
                        Layer 7 attacks are difficult to defend as the traffic can be 
                        difficult to ag as malicious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Protocol Attacks:</strong> Protocol attacks cause a service disruption 
                        by consuming all the available state table capacity of web 
                        application servers or intermediate resources like firewalls 
                        and load balancers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Volumetric Attacks:</strong> This category of attacks attempts to 
                        create congestion by consuming all available bandwidth between 
                        the target and the larger Internet. Large amounts of data are 
                        sent to a target by using a form of amplification or another 
                        means of creating massive traffic, such as requests from a botnet.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>What Next in Response to DDoS Attack?</h2>
                    <p>There are a few steps to respond against a DDoS Attack:</p>

                    <h4>1. Detection</h4>
                    <p>
                        Early detection is critical for defending against a DDoS attack. Look for warning 
                        signs, provided above, that you may be a target. DDoS detection may involve investigating 
                        the content of packets to detect Layer 7 and protocol-based attacks or utilizing 
                        rate-based measures to detect volumetric attacks. Rate-based detection is usually 
                        discussed first when it comes to DDoS attacks, but most effective DDoS attacks are not 
                        blocked using rate-based detection.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2. Filtering</h4>
                    <p>
                        A transparent filtering process helps to drop the unwanted traffic. This is done by 
                        installing effective rules on network devices to eliminate the DDoS traffic.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Diversion and redirection</h4>
                    <p>
                        This step involves diverting traffic so that it doesn't affect your critical resources. 
                        You can redirect DDoS traffic by sending it into a scrubbing center or other resource 
                        that acts as a sinkhole. It is typically recommended that you transparently communicate 
                        what is taking place so that employees and customers don't need to change their behavior 
                        to accommodate slowness.
                    </p>

                    <h4>4. Forwarding and analysis</h4>
                    <p>
                        Understanding where the DDoS attack originated is important. This knowledge can help you 
                        develop protocols to proactively protect against future attacks. While it may be tempting 
                        to try and kill off the botnet, it can create logistical problems and may result in legal 
                        ramifications. Generally, it is not recommended.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5. Alternate delivery</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is possible to use alternate resources that can almost instantaneously offer new content 
                        or open up new networking connections in the event of an attack.One of the best ways to 
                        mitigate a DDoS attack is to respond as a team and collaborate during the incident response 
                        process. The steps outlined above can only be achieved through a combination of services, 
                        devices and individuals working together.

                        The requirements for cybersecurity can vary widely from organization 
                        to organization. A role that can be extremely relevant to a specific 
                        business may not make sense for a smaller company or even a larger 
                        one but that works in another segment.
