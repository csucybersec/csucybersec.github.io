                    <h2>Microsoft Takes North Korean <strong>Hacking Group Thallium</strong> to Court</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        <b>What Happened To Microsoft?</b><br>
                        In 2019, the hacking group Thallium targeted Microsoft users such as Outlook emails by impersonating the
                        company with the aim of stealing sensitive information.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">After researching a potential target, Thallium
                        identified individual employees of that organization or associated individuals. It uses publicly available
                        information and social media interaction to do so. Next, the hackers create fake email addresses to launch
                        phishing attacks. The hackers typically impersonate legitimate services, including Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo
                        or even the company's webmail service.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/scenario6/thallium.jpg" width="40%">
                    <img src="images/scenario6/mail.png" width="35%" height="20%" style="margin-left: 20%;">

                    <p class="pad_bot2"><br>
                        In many other cases, the spoofed email appears to originate from a
                        familiar contact known by the target. The spearfishing emails include links or sophisticated redirects to fake
                        websites set up and controlled by Thallium. It used malware to compromise over nine millions of systems
                        to create <strong>Necurs, one of the world's largest botnets</strong>. The takedown of Necurs took eight years of
                        planning and coordinated legal and technical endeavors by Microsoft and its partners across
                        35 countries, according to Tom Burt, Microsoft's VP for customer security and trust
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Necurs & How was it takendown?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The network call Necurs infected over nine million computers and one of the world's largest
                        botnets.Necurs was responsible for multiple criminal scams including stealing personal information
                        and sending fake pharmaceutical emails.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Cyber-criminals use botnets to remotely take over internet-connected devices and install
                        malicious software. The software can be used to send spam, collect information about what activity the computer
                        is used for or delete information without notifying the owner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Necurs first appeared in 2012. It is believed to have had a network of more than nine million zombie computers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        To grow this network Necurs used a domain generation algorithm that created random domain
                        names the group turned into websites. It used these sites to send instructions to its army of
                        infected computers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Microsoft and its partners were able to crack Necurs' algorithm and predict what domain
                        names it would be using in the months ahead and block them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Followed after this Attack?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Microsoft sued a cyber-espionage group with North Korean links
                        tracked as Thallium for breaking into its customers' accounts and
                        networks via spear-phishing attacks with the end goal of stealing
                        sensitive information, as shown by a complaint unsealed on
                        December 27.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        "To manage and direct Thallium, Defendants have established and
                        operate a network of websites, domains, and computers on the
                        Internet, which they use to target their victims, compromise their
                        online accounts, infect their computing devices, compromise the
                        security of their networks, and steal sensitive information from
                        them," Microsoft's complaint says.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The lawsuit was filed by Microsoft on December 18 in the U.S.
                        District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, as first reported
                        by Bloomberg Law's Blake Brittain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        According to Microsoft, Thallium targets both public and private
                        industry targets and it has been observed while previously
                        attacking "government employees, organizations and individuals
                        that work on Nuclear Proliferation issues, think tanks, university
                        staff members, members of organizations that attempt to maintain
                        world peace, human rights organizations, as well as many other
                        organizations and individuals."
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The North Korean hackers are also believed to have been active
                        since at least 2010 according to Redmond's complaint, and it is
                        known for being behind spear-phishing attacks they operate via
                        legitimate services such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        A list of 50 domains used by Thallium in their attacks and taken
                        down by Microsoft on a court order is available in Appendix A of
                        the complaint.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        "Our court case against Thallium, filed in the U.S. District Court
                        for the Eastern District of Virginia, resulted in a court order
                        enabling Microsoft to take control of 50 domains that the group
                        uses to conduct its operations," said Tom Burt,
                        Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Customer Security &
                        Trust, in a blog post after this article was published.

                    <h2>What Is Phishing?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., 
                        spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing 
                        sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's 
                        infrastructure like ransomware. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated 
                        and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe 
                        everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security 
                        boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, phishing is by far the most common attack performed 
                        by cybercriminals, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre recording over twice as many 
                        incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first recorded use of the term "phishing" was in the cracking toolkit AOHell created 
                        by Koceilah Rekouche in 1995; however, it is possible that the term was used before this 
                        in a print edition of the hacker magazine 2600. The word is a leetspeak variant 
                        of fishing, probably influenced by phreaking, and alludes to the use of increasingly 
                        sophisticated lures to "fish" for users' sensitive information
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or 
                        text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing 
                        sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Types of Phishing Attack</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many types of phishing attacks:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Email phishing<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;1. Spear phishing<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;2. Whaling and CEO fraud<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;3. Clone phishing<br><br>
                        2. Voice phishing<br><br>
                        3. SMS phishing<br><br>
                        4. Page hijacking<br><br>
                        5. Calendar phishing
                    </p>

                    <h2>Common Features of Phishing Emails</h2>
                    <p>
                        1. <b>Too Good To Be True</b> - Lucrative offers and eye-catching or attention-grabbing statements are designed to attract people's attention immediately. For instance, many claim that you have won an iPhone, a lottery, or some other lavish prize. Just don't click on any suspicious emails. Remember that if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!

                    <p>
                        2. <b>Sense of Urgency</b> - A favorite tactic amongst cybercriminals is to ask you to act fast because the super deals are only for a limited time. Some of them will even tell you that you have only a few minutes to respond. When you come across these kinds of emails, it's best to just ignore them. Sometimes, they will tell you that your account will be suspended unless you update your personal details immediately. Most reliable organizations give ample time before they terminate an account and they never ask patrons to update personal details over the Internet. When in doubt, visit the source directly rather than clicking a link in an email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. <b>Hyperlinks</b> - A link may not be all it appears to be. Hovering over a link shows you the actual URL where you will be directed upon clicking on it. It could be completely different or it could be a popular website with a misspelling, for instance www.bankofarnerica.com - the 'm' is actually an 'r' and an 'n', so look carefully.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. <b>Attachments</b> - If you see an attachment in an email you weren't expecting or that doesn't make sense, don't open it! They often contain payloads like ransomware or other viruses. The only file type that is always safe to click on is a .txt file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. <b>Unusual Sender</b> - Whether it looks like it's from someone you don't know or someone you do know, if anything seems out of the ordinary, unexpected, out of character or just suspicious in general don't click on it!

                        The requirements for cybersecurity can vary widely from organization 
                        to organization. A role that can be extremely relevant to a specific

                        one but that works in another segment.
