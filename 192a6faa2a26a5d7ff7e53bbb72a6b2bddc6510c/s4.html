                            CREEPY COOKIES THAT track all your online activity are (slowly) being eradicated. In recent years 
                            major web browsers, including Safari and Firefox, have restricted the practice. Even Chrome has 
                            realized that cookies present a privacy nightmare. But stopping them ends only one kind of online 
                            tracking—others are arguably worse.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The Internet's core principles such as universality of access and transparency has long begun to fade
                        away. Groups of concerned people including Tim Berners-Lee launched recently Contract for the Web
                        project advocates that the principles of an open web need to be safeguarded. Although no one is denied
                        their right to full internet access, Internet censorship is on the rise. It allows a state agency
                        to block the information flow to and from a black-listed websites. One recent approach is called
                        Website fingerprinting attack. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        It utilizes machine learning techniques to learn and identify unique
                        traffic pattern when accessing, for example, the New York Times website. When a similar traffic pattern
                        is observed, the attacker can block its access. However, considering the fact that the identification of such
                        connections is not guaranteed to be accurate, it is also possible that the censor may start deteriorating the
                        quality of service by, for example, randomly dropping packets, or throttling the traffic. 
                    </p>    
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        To combat against website fingerprinting attacks, many efforts have been made on improving the Tor network itself or
                        developing ones on top of Tor. This is because Tor itself is already proven to be resilient to website fingerprinting 
                        attacks to some degree. Major media websites, such as BBC News, also adopted Tor,
                        to ensure that their contents can be distributed to audiences without censorship.

                    <h2>What Is Fingerprinting?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The exact configuration of lines and swirls that make up your fingerprints are thought to be unique 
                        to you. Similarly, your browser fingerprint is a set of information that's collected from your phone 
                        or laptop each time you use it that advertisers can eventually link back to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It takes information about your browser, your network, your device and combines it together to create 
                        a set of characteristics that is mostly unique to you,” says Tanvi Vyas, a principal engineer at Firefox. 
                        The data that makes up your fingerprint can include the language you use, keyboard layout, your timezone, 
                        whether you have cookies turned on, the version of the operating system your device runs, and much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By combining all this information into a fingerprint, it's possible for advertisers to recognize you 
                        as you move from one website to the next. Multiple studies looking at fingerprinting have found that 
                        around 80 to 90 percent of browser fingerprints are unique. Fingerprinting is often done by advertising 
                        technology companies that insert their code onto websites. Fingerprinting code—which comes in the form 
                        of a variety of scripts, such as the FingerprintJS library—is deployed by dozens of ad tech firms to 
                        collect data about your online activity. Sometimes websites that have fingerprinting scripts on them don't 
                        even know about it. And the companies are often opaque and unclear in the ways they track you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once established, someone's fingerprint can potentially be combined with other personal information—such 
                        as linking it with existing profiles or information murky data brokers hold about you. “There are so many 
                        data sets available today, and there are so many other means to connect your fingerprint with other identifying 
                        information,” says Nataliia Bielova, a research scientist at France's National Institute for Research in Digital 
                        Science and Technology, who is currently working at the French data regulator, CNIL.

                    <h2>So How Bad Is It?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While there's little transparency around the companies that run fingerprinting scripts, the practice is verifiably 
                        widespread across the web. Many of the websites you visit will fingerprint your device; research from 2020 found 
                        a quarter of the world's top 10,000 websites running fingerprinting scripts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New ways of fingerprinting are being created too. “The existing fingerprinting algorithms are not the upper 
                        boundary in terms of trackability,” says Gaston Pugliese, a research fellow at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität 
                        in Germany, who has studied the long-term impact of fingerprinting. For instance, earlier this year researchers 
                        proved they could create fingerprints of GPUs to identify people. Tracking people across different browsers is 
                        also possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But not all fingerprinting is bad. David Emm, a principal security researcher at Kaspersky, says the technique 
                        can often be used as a way to spot potential fraud, such as banks using it to identify suspicious behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the widespread use of fingerprinting for targeted advertising and tracking people's online movement 
                        raises legal problems. Across Europe regulators have been calling for a clampdown on cookie banners, which 
                        appear on websites asking people if they give their permission to be tracked. The banners are so ubiquitous 
                        (and frustrating) that people largely click Accept and don't understand how they are agreeing to be tracked—that's 
                        leaving aside the fact that many cookie banners may not even do what they claim.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How Can You Stop It?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike cookies, it's hard to stop fingerprinting. Cookies are stored in your browser, and it's possible to 
                        delete your cookie history, block them, or turn them off entirely. “With the fingerprinting, it's all invisible,” 
                        Emm says. “People don't know about it; they don't see it.” When the EFF first detailed fingerprinting in 2010, 
                        it said it was “akin to a cookie that cannot be deleted.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Various browser plugins claim to help reduce or stop fingerprinting, but there's a mix in quality. A 2019 study 
                        by a researcher from Snap and two US academics found many anti-fingerprinting tools aren't that useful. The 
                        biggest thing you can do to stop fingerprinting is pick a browser that limits tracking and increases privacy.

                        The requirements for cybersecurity can vary widely from organization
