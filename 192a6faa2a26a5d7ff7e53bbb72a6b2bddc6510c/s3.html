                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        On Feb 14, 2015, a Cyber-criminal, who is on the Interpol and the FBI's 
                        most wanted list and was involved in defrauding several companies and 
                        individuals of over USD 50 million, was arrested from Pakistan's biggest 
                        city, Karachi.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">    
                        According to the FBI website, Aziz Uddin was involved 
                        in an international communication scheme and hacking venture that defrauded 
                        several companies and individuals, mostly in New Jerzy, of over USD 50 
                        million from November 2008 to April 2012. FBI had also offered a 
                        reward of up to USD 50,000 for information that leads to his arrest.

                    <h2>    
                        Here is what the hackers did:
                    </h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">    
                        They let other people's phones dialed pay-per-minute numbers that they owned, 
                        turning their phones into ATMs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">    
                        <strong>How did they carry out the plan:</strong><br>
                        <p>&#9679; For a phone with remote voicemail access capability, they hack into the phone 
                        and change the permanent forwarding number.</p>
                        <p>&#9679; Now the next time anyone dials a phone it will place a new call to the 
                        pay-per-minute line.</p>
                        <p>&#9679; A more rewarding method is PBX hacking along with voice-over 
                        IP or VOIP phones and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) used in many companies. The 
                        hackers find the IP address of insecure PBXs and try to make a call using that 
                        PBX.</p>
                        <p>&#9679; They use robo-dialers, dialing hundreds of times a day or thousands of times 
                        in a weekend.</p>
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/scenario3/flow.png">
                    <p class="pad_bot2">    
                        Victims contact the police but they aren't equipped to handle 
                        international crimes because clls are almost always going to foreign countries. 
                        They contact the FBI but the FBI is usually only interested in threats against 
                        the government or crimes that were over one million dollars in damages.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">    
                        Most of this PBX hacking is in the tens of thousands. In 2012 the FBI did receive enough 
                        reports about PBX hacking that they began looking at the data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How It Works?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        It's a little bit complicated, so imagine it this way: Someone steals your iPhone. 
                        But instead of just selling it on Craigslist, they use it to dial one of those 
                        $3-per-minute phone sex lines, over and over, until you've racked up thousands of dollars in fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Now, imagine that same person who stole your iPhone actually owns that sex line 
                        that he was dialing, and you -- the unsuspecting user -- are forced to pay the 
                        bill to your carrier at the end of the month. Unfortunately, if you try to dispute 
                        the bill, your carrier will just shrug -- according to the terms of pretty much 
                        all user agreements, whoever actually owns the line is on the hook for the bill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        In Uddin's case, the hacked entities were seemingly random businesses. The FBI's 
                        official indictment doesn't name specific entities, but it lists examples: One 
                        business in Livingston, New Jersey, was hacked for $24,120. Another, in Englewood, 
                        New Jersey, was charged $83,839.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The hacks themselves typically lasted for less than a day, usually on a weekend, 
                        when no one is in the office.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        One might think this type of hacking is relatively fringe -- it's not. Each year, 
                        PBX hackers pilfer some $5 billion from U.S. companies, an amount that places 
                        their scam in direct competition with stolen-credit-card scams. And despite the 
                        fact that it's so massive, and on the rise, few people seem to talk about it. 
                        “It's like the ugly stepsister of credit card fraud,” says Shane MacDougall, 
                        a well-known cybercrime expert. "There's even people in the security industry 
                        that don't know about it.”

                    <h2>What Is PBX Hacking and How Does It Work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is a private telephone network that handles 
                        an organization's internal and external communications. For external connections, 
                        the PBX connects to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using a 
                        Telecommunication Service Provider (TSP) or an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hackers target PBX networks in ways that can impact the company. Using the PBX, 
                        they might place long-distance calls for free, leaving the company to pay the 
                        bills. Hackers might steal data or simply render the network unusable. Such 
                        hackers who specialize in hacking phone systems are called phreakers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PBX hacking was traditionally done on analogue PBX systems using various methods. 
                        When IP PBX systems were introduced in the 1990s, hacking methods were adapted to 
                        these newer networks. There are many best practices that companies can follow to 
                        mitigate the dangers of PBX hacking.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How does PBX system get hacked?</h2>

                    <p>
                        DISA and voice mail are classic ways for phreakers to penetrate the organisation 
                        PBX System. Also, DoS acts as one of severe attacks towards the PBX System.

                        <p>
                            &#9679; Brute force attack: It is a trial and error method until the password or 
                            log-in credentials or encryption keys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#9679; DISA and Voice Mails: DISA(Direct Inward System Access) is a service provided 
                            by PBX where the user's dials into PBX and then give information for authorisation 
                            to use PBX service dial local user. The authorisation process comprises the user's 
                            account, user's password and callerID.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &#9679; Denial of Service Attack(DoS): The denial of service attack makes telephony service 
                            unavailable by causing physical damage or software strategies and denying telephones 
                            to place or receive calls. It works by flooding networks with fake traffic or server 
                            request generated by machines compromised by viruses and malware.
                        </p>

                    <h2>How to identify if you have become a victim?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are some indications to notify the victim whether they have been hacked:
                        <p>
                            &#9679; Overload occurring in the incoming and outgoing trunks.

                        <p>
                            &#9679; Any kind of lengthy calls or calls to premium rate services during late-night 
                            hours or weekends and holidays.

                        <p>
                            &#9679; Any signs of war dialing like short calls or wrong number calls or any sign 
                            of social engineering.

                        one but that works in another segment.
